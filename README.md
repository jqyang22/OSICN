# Can Spectral Information Work While Extracting Spatial Distribution? — An Online Spectral Information Compensation Network for HSI Classification
Tensorflow implementation of OSICN for hyperspectral image classification.
# Installation
Install Tensorflow 2.4.0 with Python 3.8.
# Usage
Please first change the path in the code, and then run ('GPU_Number' can be selected as '0, 1, 2...'):  
  
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=GPU_Number python ./OSICN.py  
  
Please note that the results may be varied due to differences in the training of the network.
